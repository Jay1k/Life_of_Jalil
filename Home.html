      <p class="w3-large">My name is jalil mackey I am now 16 years old, and a brother to 4. 
I was born 6/4/02 in broward county florida, and I currently attend Summit Highschool in El cerrito. My hobbies are video games, basketball and having fun. I enjoy Hanging out with friens and family, The things I enjoy most in life is time, and family. Video games have always been in my life since I was in diapers, it ewas always an excape and something I was always intressted in, gaming took me into another world. Basketball was my first sport, I stopped playing as a kid because of a bad experience I've had which is now laughable since im older, Basketball havent found its way in my life until the summer of 2017 when I became more interested in it and wanted to bring my game to a higher level, I see myself in about 4 years in the nba or G-League. A couple players game I look after is, kevin durant and kyrie irving, I feel like neither player gets the respect they deserve but they are really once in a life time players

      <p><font size="3" color="black">Growing up video games were one of the first intrests Ive had. The first console I've had was a gamecube made by nintendo, video games always caught my attention since a little boy from Sonic 3 all the way to Fortnite today. In my young years I wasnt the best at video games because I had an older brother who was always better then men, but as the years went by I feel like I can be a proffesional gamer, Ive came pretty far in gaming. Video games as long as they are around will always be a hobby/fun thing to do no matter how old I get, Video games will always be an intrest of mine and I would love to create my own block buster in the future.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" color="black"> This is a picture of my favorite video game "CALL OF DUTY MODERN WAREFARE 2" This game was lengendary to all gamers and you've missed out on greatness if you never witnessed this game when it was in its prime. Prior to being released in November 9, 2009 MW2 was a game that brought the best graphics and gameplay in the buisness, New features such as Special ops and a bigger and better multiplayer experience for the people of the gaming community blowing Halo out the water and dethrowning it for units sold. in 2010 alone only 2 months after release MW2 sold over 20 million copies worldwide boosting up the charts for best game to be releaed and recorded foor sells. The $60 game has been a legendary era birthing now famous FaZe Clan, Optic Clan, Rapper Logic and numerous others bringing them into stardom with the "Trickshotting" Invention. This game has birth many of people bringing them an amazing career and gaining fan base. Fast forward to 2018 The game is almost 10 years old, and rumours are there will be a remaster of the late Great game, to hit the market once again for its 10 year aniversary. </font></p>

      <p><font size="5" color="black">Basketball</font></p>
      <p class="w3-text-BLACK"> Basketball has always been my favorite sport even before I knew it myself. I was always a fan of the game,having basketball birthday themes, alot of legend jerseys, and so much more. It took me most of my life to realize my love for basketball, Plauying many other sports before actually playing the sport for the first time in the 10th grade. Now going to the 11th I plan on improving my game tromendously this upcoming season, Starting to workout more, get into weights etc. Basketball Is super interesting to me because there is so many things you can do to score, style you can have in the game, passing dribbling etc. I take most of my game from my favorite player Kevin Durant, but I dont think ill be as tall as him so, I will have to work on my game to play as a Guard. Kevin durant, an kyrie Irving are my favorite players, I dont believe they get as much recognition as they need, very great players over looked because of lebron james. I plan to be able to play like kyrie irving by my senior year, My future Goal is to get into the NBA, Always been a deep down dream for myself.  </p><br>

    <h1>Mindfulness and Conclusion</h1><br>
    <p>Mindfulnes is a thing ive been doing since a kid in elementary, and still used till this day. Everyday in The Hidden Genius Project we reflect on mindfulness in the morning. We have a topic, and a quote of the day to study and reflect on everyday. I was introduced to Mindfulness in the 3rd grade at richmond college prep. Back then it was mostly yoa, and breathing to overcome tough situations. Now that I get older mindfulness is also about, things that are in your community you can do to make better, overcoming long term problems, like racism. I feel like if everyone had a time to reflect on their life or way they function in the world, they would have a regret because they are'nt mindful of their choices.</p>

Binary and Analog
Today in computer science we basically went over the simplicity of certain things connected to electronics and how Things worked. We learned what binary devices, and bits was, and also how they worked. We also took notes on questions comparing which are easier to build and how to work with it. We also worked on analogs. Binary devices are simple and easy to build,Has unambiguous signals, and flawless copies.

      <p>Processing Data 7/2/18
</p>
<p>The processor runs bytes of information We talked about electric operations, when programs are running the processor is constantly running tiny electric operations.These tiny electronic operations are performed one at a time. But billions of them are performed per second, and billions of small operations can add up to a large and useful action.

<P>Processing   Data in terminal

High level programming
Javascript things that are processed for us to understand.
-takes orders step by step
- processes then act on it.


Low level 
Only things the computer can read
Binary language
Transfers from english to cpu terms



Ram gives list of instructions.

Ch4. summary
Today in Computer science we learned about processed information. We also learned about how the information is transferred between human language and computer information, and language. For example if you put a command inside of a computer, it will send 0’s and 1’s until it reaches the converter and popups up as a command, message etc. to the the screen of the pc.

<p>CS MINDFULNESS</p>
<p>Today in computer science we learned about the different type of files and folders. The folders all come from the root folder which are opened from commands in the terminal. We learned; Text.file, image.file, video.file, internet.file. The filesgoes inside the folders we were talking about; var, log, auth.log etc.

<p>Binary Signals pt 2
</p>
<p>In this part of Chapter 2 I learned  an analog signal may continuously change in their value. We talked about sign waves and that the sign waves are analog signals. Analog’s exact value can change at any time. Anything below a threshold will be on on, but if it is above  the threshold it is considered on.  It’s really easy to determine if the voltage is above or below the threshold.

<P>Program Data in Terminal - Becoming A programmer</P>

<p>Today we began learning to become a programmer we talked about the difference between coding and programming, Coding is just writing instructions in any type of language that is designed to talk to a computer, Code are the instructions being written, and a coder is the person that translate the words to Numbers which is Binary that the computer can understand. Programming means to program a machine or application to run (execute) without any errors,  A program is a set of instructions that were given to it by a programmer, a programmer creates things, they develop logic, they analyze a problem and try to create solutions for that problem.

<p>Understanding file systems and algorithms</p>

<p>
Today in CS we learned what a file system is and how to use them to create a tree structure. .A file is a collection of related information that is recorded on secondary storage. Or file is a collection of logically related entities. From user’s perspective a file is the smallest allotment of logical secondary storage.

<p>Beginning our webpage
</p>

<p>Today in CS we learned what the basic html structure is. The structure is <!DOCTYPE HTML>, <HTML>, </HEAD>,</HEAD>, <BODY>, </BODY>  AND </HTML>. This is important for the webpage because they are like the main commands.  We downloaded programs like Sublime, yamp, basic html structure, and commentins.</p>
